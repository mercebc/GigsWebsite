Hey Guys

Commands that we used at codebar:

`ls` - list files in the current folder
`ls -a` - list all files including the hidden ones that begin with a .
`mkdir` - make a directory
`cd` - change into a directory

Git commands:
`git init`
`git status` - tells you if you have files that are ready to staged (git add-ed) or have been added are ready to be committed
`git add .` - git add all the files in folder in prep for git committing
`git add <file name>` - add just that file - sometimes want to make a commit that saves the changes to just some of the files - use this to add them individually
`git commit -m "msg goes here"`
`git clone <url from to a repo on github, bitbucket or somewhere>` - gets the repo of code and puts on your local machine

Here are some resources that will remind you of how whack git is:
